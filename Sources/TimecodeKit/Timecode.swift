/// - A variety of initializers and methods are available for string and numeric representation, validation, and conversion
/// - Mathematical operators are available between two instances: `+`, `-`, `*`, `\`
/// - Compared operators are available between two instances (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`)
/// - `Range` and `Stride` can be formed between two instances
